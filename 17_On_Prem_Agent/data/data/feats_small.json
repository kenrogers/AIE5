If you roll an odd number, one random creature within 30 feet of you (not including you) takes force damage equal to the number rolled. If no other creatures are in range, you take the damage."

										"At the DM's option, a character who has the Aberrant Dragonmark feat has a chance of manifesting greater power. Upon reaching 10th level, such a character has a {@chance 10} chance of gaining an {@filter epic boon|rewards|type=boon} from among the options in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. If the character fails to gain a boon, they have a {@chance 10} chance the next time they gain a level.",

The character also permanently loses one of their Hit Dice, and their hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to a roll of that die plus their Constitution modifier (minimum reduction of 1). This reduction can't be reversed by any means."
