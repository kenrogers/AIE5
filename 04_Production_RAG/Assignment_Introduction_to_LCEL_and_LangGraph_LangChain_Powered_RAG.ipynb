Let us ponder these enchanted morsels, wrapped in riddles and swathed in cheese-laden wisdom:\\n\\n1. **Curds of Code**: Like a fine Roquefort, pungent with flavor, start with the foundational blocks. Immerse yourself in the vast cream of Python’s libraries and frameworks. Explore *NumPy* and *Pandas*, for they are the Brie of data manipulation—meltingly delicious!\\n\\n2. **Aged Cheddar Practice**: Much like an aged Cheddar, the richness of your skills comes with time. Write code daily, be it a short script or a grand project. Each line is like a wheel of cheese, growing sharper with each turn of the wheel.\\n\\n3. **Curds in the Community**: Engage with fellow alchemists of the code! Join forums and platforms such as Stack Overflow and GitHub, where the freshest, cheesemongering minds gather. Contributing is akin to sharing a Fondue pot—together we create a blend that warms the very spirit of programming!\\n\\n4. **Relearn the Rinds**: Just as the rind of a Camembert protects its creamy core, do not shy away from revisiting the fundamentals. Review the graceful elegance of functions, classes, and loops—they are the crusty base that sustains the flavorful fillings of your knowledge.\\n\\n5. **A Dash of Debugging**: When errors abound, be not rash—debug with the precision of a cheese-slicer. Learn to wield the debugger and unravel your code like unraveling a fine Feta; each crumb reveals a story, and persists against the tang of errors.\\n\\n6. **A Pinch of Projects**: Undertake personal or open-source projects, if you please! Each creation is akin to crafting a cheese wheel, bringing uniqueness from your own hands. From web applications to data visualizations, find delight in the spectrum of taste and texture.\\n\\n7. **The Flavor of Functionality**: Explore the flavors of functional programming. Libraries like *functools* and *itertools* can be the truffle oil drizzled over a simple dish, enhancing sophistication and delight in your coding cuisine.\\n\\nSo, dear seeker of wisdom, as you embark on this quest through the enchanted woodland of Python, may your skills bloom as a fine cheese does in the cellar.

        "\n",
        "In LangChain, a Runnable is like a LEGO brick in your AI application - it's a standardized component that can be easily connected with other components. The real power of Runnables comes from their ability to be combined in flexible ways using LCEL (LangChain Expression Language).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Universal Interface\n",
        "Every Runnable in LangChain follows the same pattern:\n",
        "- Takes an input\n",
        "- Performs some operation\n",
        "- Returns an output\n",
        "\n",
        "This consistency means you can treat different components (like models, retrievers, or parsers) in the same way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Built-in Parallelization\n",
        "Runnables come with methods for handling multiple inputs efficiently:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Process inputs in parallel, maintain order\n",
        "results = chain.batch([input1, input2, input3])\n",
        "\n",
        "# Process inputs as they complete\n",
        "for result in chain.batch_as_completed([input1, input2, input3]):\n",
        "    print(result)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Streaming Support\n",
        "Perfect for responsive applications:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Stream outputs as they're generated\n",
        "for chunk in chain.stream({\"query\": \"Tell me a story\"}):\n",
        "    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Easy Composition\n",
        "The `|` operator makes building pipelines intuitive:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Create a basic RAG chain\n",
        "rag_chain = retriever | prompt | model | output_parser\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Types of Runnables\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Language Models**: Like our `ChatOpenAI` instance\n",
        "- **Prompt Templates**: Format inputs consistently\n",

        "#### Why Cycles?\n",

        "#### Why LangGraph?\n",

        "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangGraph leverages a `StatefulGraph` which uses an `AgentState` object to pass information between the various nodes of the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are more options than what we'll see below - but this `AgentState` object is one that is stored in a `TypedDict` with the key `messages` and the value is a `Sequence` of `BaseMessages` that will be appended to whenever the state changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, in our example here, we're focusing on a simpler `State` object:\n",

        "    response: str\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **We initialize our state object**:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Our user submits a query to our application.**  \n",
        "   We store the user's question in `state[\"question\"]`. Now we have:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",
        "       \"context\": [],\n",
        "       \"response\": \"\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **We pass our state object to an Agent node** which is able to read the current state. It will use the value of `state[\"question\"]` as input and might retrieve some context documents related to the question. It then generates a response which it stores in `state[\"response\"]`. For example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   {\n",
        "       \"question\": \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\",\n",

        "       \"response\": \"The Eiffel Tower is about 324 meters tall...\"\n",
        "   }\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "That's it! The important part is that we have a consistent object (`State`) that's passed around, holding the crucial information as we go from one node to the next. This ensures our application has a single source of truth about what has happened so far and what is happening now.\n",

So something like \"Didn't find the answer\" -> goes to another node that will call a different prompt to think about the question differently or something like that. Could also have a dedicated fact checking node that calls the Perplexity API or something to fact check any generated content."
