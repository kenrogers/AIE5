By passing the same integer to all of our calls, we can make our put much more predictable and deterministic. On top of this, we can make sure that all of our other parameters like our prompts and the `temperature` parameter are consistent across all API calls. We can track changes on OpenAI's side using the `system_fingerprint` field, and make necessary changes when that field changes to get our output in line. If these are all the same across our API calls, we'll have much more deterministic output."

Daylight Hours\\nUnderstanding normal physiology of sleep is imperative to understanding dysfunc-\\ntional sleep and circadian rhythms. Sleep is a necessary and useful physiological process\\nin humans, controlled by circadian rhythms. These circadian rhythms are daily biological\\ncycles that control a large portion of physiological processes [ 10]. Both natural and artiﬁcial\\nlight heavily inﬂuences circadian rhythms by entraining “endogenous oscillators” that are\\ncomposed of neural, hormonal, and genetic elements [ 11]. There are central and periph-\\neral oscillators that play roles in speciﬁc parts of the circadian system. The major central\\noscillator is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN); a paired nucleus in the hypothalamus of\\nhumans and other mammals that receives input from speciﬁc neurons in the retina [ 12].\\nPeripheral oscillators are controlled by the rhythm of the SCN',\n",

Neurologic\\ndisorders, such as traumatic brain injury, coma, and hypnic headaches have also been cor-\\nrelated with rhythm disruption [ 58–60]. The mechanisms for the disruption of melatonin\\nrhythms with these disorders are unclear; further research is required to further elucidate\\nthe relationship between diseases and their effect on circadian timing and rhythms. There\\nwere 14 studies that dealt with subjects with controlled disease, whereas 9 dealt with\\nsubjects with uncontrolled disease. Both of these groups were shown to have melatonin\\nrhythms that differed from the expected. Further research is necessary to establish whether\\nrhythms are equally disrupted in controlled and uncontrolled disease or if there is some\\nsigniﬁcant difference.\\nAs for treatment of sleep and circadian rhythm disorders, the literature yields two\\nmain categories both modalities: light therapy a',\n",

It is a state of con-\\nsciousness that occurs in a series of stages where the senses are largely ignored, motor\\nfunction is mostly inhibited, and dreaming can occur [ 1]. These stages include Stages I to\\nIV and Rapid Eye Movement (REM). The necessary or proper quantity and quality of sleep\\nmaintains brain, heart, and immune health [ 2] as well as aiding in memory consolidation\\nand restoration of brain function [3].\\nHumans normally experience sleep cyclically once a day due to a tightly regulated\\ncircadian control. Depending on age, the recommended duration of sleep differs. For\\nexample, adolescents should sleep for 9 h per night while adults only need 7–8 h [ 1].\\nNeuronal, neurotransmitter, hormonal, and genetic factors regulate the propensity to\\nsleep, notably adenosine, serotonin, and melatonin.
